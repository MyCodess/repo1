4.15 Where to store the local configuration permanently?

You have two options. Either you use the built-in configuration file for cdrecord, or you use a shell wrapper like the one shown below. This shell script reads a configuration file, which lists the options and parameters for cdrecord line by line. The names are exactly the same as on the command line, but without the leading dash. Comments are allowed. Example:

# be verbose
v
# set the speed of the writer
speed=2
# the device-coordinates in the form BUS,ID,LUN
dev=0,6,0

The configuration files for the wrapper belong into /etc/cdrecord/ and must be referenced on the command line. Example: if you want to refer to the configuration /etc/cdrecord/mywriter.cfg, then you can issue the command "cdrecord.sh mywriter.cfg -audio track1...". Everything after mywrite.cfg is passed to cdrecord.

#! /bin/bash

CFGDIR="/etc/cdrecord"

CFG="$1"
shift
ARGS_LEFT="$@"

if [ ! -f "$CFGDIR/$CFG" ]
then
    echo "Configuration file $CFGDIR/$CFG not found. Exiting."
    exit 1
fi

while read LINE
do
    case $LINE in
        \#*|"") continue;;
    esac
    old_IFS="$IFS"
    IFS="$IFS="
    set -- $LINE
    IFS="$old_IFS"
    O_NAME="$1"
    O_VALUE=""
    while shift
    do
        case $1 in
            "") continue;;
        esac
        O_VALUE="$1"
    done

    if [ -z "$O_VALUE" ]
    then
        O_CDRECORD="$O_CDRECORD -$O_NAME "
        continue
    fi
    O_CDRECORD="$O_CDRECORD $O_NAME=$O_VALUE "
    
done < "$CFGDIR/$CFG"

set -x    #DEBUG
exec cdrecord $O_CDRECORD $ARGS_LEFT
echo "Execution of cdrecord failed."
